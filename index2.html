  <title>A Word Of Caution To Artists Thinking Of Performing In Crimea</title>

    <h1>A word of <span class='warning'>caution</span> to artists<br />thinking of performing in <span class='warning'>Crimea</span></h1>
    <footer>
      <h2>There are <span class='white'>three serious reasons</span> not to go to Crimea as an artist<br />invited to perform there</h2>
    </footer>
  </header>
  <section class='reason'>
    <p class="reason">Reason 1</p>
    <h3>You <span class='warning'>WILL</span> make a political statement</h3>
    <p class="description" id="description1">
      You may not be pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian, you may hate this conflict, and may want it to end. Your Russian and Ukrainian fans are also very tired and nobody will judge you if you visit Moscow or Kyiv.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='uppercase'>However, if you go to Crimea you <span class='warning'>WILL</span>:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Go through one of the Russian airports, since there are no direct flights from any of the other countries anymore (Crimean airports are not recognized by ICAO as Russian).</li>
        <li>Perform under Russian flags. Isn't that a political statement?</li>
        <li>Hurt all your Ukrainian fans; some of their friends and family members had to leave everything and flee Crimea to rescue their right to freedom. However, if you visit any Russian territories (the Crimean Peninsula is not), not a single Ukrainian will care.</li>
        <li>Break Ukrainian immigration laws and the law on occupied territories, thus prohibiting yourself from visiting Ukraine in the future. Please refer to the recent visit of French far-right politicians to Crimea -- some of them changed their minds at the last moment (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33633874">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33633874</a>).</li>
        <li>Not only will you break the laws of Ukraine, but you will also leave a footprint of occupation on everything you do there. You will conclude an agreement with a Russian legal entity that will pay taxes to the Russian treasury. You will live in a hotel that is registered under Russian law and your contract and even your boarding pass will say Simferopol, Russia. How does that correspond to your statement that you didn't take anyone's side?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Perhaps more importantly, you <span class='warning'>WILL NOT</span> pass Ukrainian passport control, since the Ukrainian border service does not have access to the airports, which means that, according to the laws of the majority of UN states, you will illegally visit an occupied territory of Ukraine.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class='reason'>
    <p class="reason">Reason 2</p>
    <h3>You <span class='warning'>WILL</span> break the laws of the US and the EU</h3>
    <p class="description">
      According to the law on sanctions, all subjects of EU or US legislation are prohibited from providing services to Crimea. That means that you can be liable to fines that may exceed your fee from performing in Crimea.<br />Consult your lawyers!
      <span class="uppercase">Here are the quotes from the mentioned laws:</span>
      <p>
        "(a) The following are prohibited: <...>
(iii) the exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to the Crimea region of Ukraine"<br />
(http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo4.pdf)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ukrainian authorities have advised EU citizens not to visit Crimea and Sevastopol. Any
EU citizen who wants to travel to this area will need to obtain a visa."<br />

    <p class="reason">Reason 3</p>
    <h3>You <span class='warning'>WILL</span> hurt your reputation</h3>
    <p class="description">
      There are other talented people who didn't care about politics and ended up hurting their reputation, losing money, and simply looking stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      One example is Hillary Swank visiting Chechnya's dictator Kadyrov's birthday party. She had to fire her managers, contribute remuneration for charity, and publicly apologize. The reason cited was the human rights situation in Chechnya.<br />
      (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/hilary-swank-regrets-chechen-party)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is information from Human Rights Watch regarding the dire situation of human rights, this time in Crimea:<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Mariah Carey, Beyonc&eacute; and others have also in the past made mistakes of performing in the wrong places and not caring where the money came from: <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, some of them had to contribute money to charity and apologize just to mitigate the PR disaster.

    So please think again, consult your managers, and don't take this decision lightly
